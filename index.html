                        As a “hobby” beekeeper, I&#39;m fascinated with the behaviour of bees and, as a designer, I’m interested in sharing this
                        wonder with others through a metaphorical recreation of a honeybee’s sensorium. HIVE&#39;s hexagonal
                        wood cells imitate selected traits of the honeybee: honeycomb structure, the bee&#39;s vision, and
                        swarm communication. Interacting with HIVE prompts us to consider the value of biomimesis (copying
                        the systems and processes of nature) reminding us we can learn much from other creatures&#39; ways
                        of thinking, constructing, producing, and consuming.

                        What is Hive?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Hive is comprised of plywood “clusters”, each made up of three hexagons (13.0 cm x 14.8 cm x 13.3 cm) and a semi-transparent
                        face. The cluster houses the electronic components, which including an Arduino Uno that regulates
                        the interactive behavior of the installation, an accelerometer, speaker, LEDs, and Lithium Polymer
                        battery. As well each triumvirate contains exterior sensors which detect to other clusters and human
                        touch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clusters can be interacted with in numerous ways. Rotating a cluster will cause an RGB LED to cycle through the rainbow of
                        colours. Bringing two clusters into contact will trigger both to emit sound. Magnets on the back
                        of the clusters allow them to be position onto a magnetic wall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the name of the installation implies, Hive steals from the honeybee both in terms of the construction of the installation
                        and as well the behaviour it seeks to elicit from participants. This borrow from an organism is known
                        as biomimesis, a type of designing that uses naturally occurring traits for human creations (Velcro
                        is an example of this as it is designed after Burdock seeds). In the case I choose to borrow from
                        the honeybee as it is an organism I’m familiar with in my pass time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hive has two purposes: firstly, to find ways to use the characteristics of a honeybee as an artistic medium and, secondly
                        to provide participants with simple and easy-to-understand forms that, when arranged in a pattern,
                        transform an indoor space into a metaphorical recreation of a honeybee’s sensorium giving us a glimpse
                        of the world from a bee's perspective.

                        The hexagon is a robust shape whose design value not only comes from millennia of evolutionary refinement, but also from
                        our human curiosity and fascination with the origins of such a complex, highly refined structure.
                        One such example is the Giant’s Causeway in Scotland, whose naturally formed hexagonal stones are
                        linked to mythology. Folklore describes the stone formations as the works of mythical creatures that
                        were attempting to build a causeway to the island of Staffa.

                    <p>
                        I believe biomimesis isn’t only mimicking physical properties of an organic system but also the associations (spiritual,
                        scientific, cultural) and meanings we have ascribed to nature and other creatures.
                        <i>Hive’s</i> design seeks to upset our usual reception of the world by letting us experience our surroundings
                        through a simulation of the honeybee's perceptual apparatuses.

                        <i>Hive</i> is comprised of numerous tangible and stackable hexagonal “clusters” which participants
                        are invited to manipulate in order to construct an interactive honeycomb/wall. This wall assembly
                        design is drawing off
                        <i>WALL</i>, a previous interactive work of mine which transforms the shape of an HIV cell into a building
                        block for a prototypical wall design. Twelve interlocking cubes, each of which contain half of a
                        protruding HIV-like cell can be combined in a limited number of ways to form a small wall whose prototypical
                        façade makes use of a repeating organic form.
                        <i>Hive</i>, too, makes use of this modular approach by using the hexagon as a motif for an interchangeable
                        structure whose repeating shape reveals how capable natural patterns can be when used for human design.

                        <!-- Ommatidium -->
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Unlike our eye which has only one lens, the honeybee’s eye is comprised of thousands of lenses called ommatidium. An individual
                        ommatidia is comprised of a lens, a cone, nine photoreceptor cells (Retinular Cell), a Rhabdomere
                        (rod like structure), and a screening pigment. The nine photoreceptor cells are sensitive to green,
                        blue, ultraviolet, and polarized ultraviolet light, making the honeybee blind to red light. This
                        arrangement of cells gives the ommatidium a mesh-like appearance when viewed through a microscope.
                    </p>


                    <div class="image_container gallery-omma grid">

                    <p>
                        Similar to how the rods and cones of the human eye work, the ommatidia sends colour information through an optic nerve to
                        the brain which then forms an image. However, because of the number and size of ommatidia contained
                        in a bee's eye, the light information received is fairly narrow, resulting in the image appearing
                        grainy and needlepoint-like. The density of ommatidium in the eye is dependent on the honeybee’s
                        gender. Worker bees (female) have around 4500 ommatidia in each eye, while drones (male) have around
                        7500. This results in the drone seeing in a higher resolution as they must be able, at a far distance,
                        to readily spot the Queen for mating purposes. The Queen, however, has little use for vision as her
                        tasks are limited to reproduction and keeping hive unity with pheromones, and therefore she only
                        sees at a resolution of 3500 ommatidia per eye.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Hive</i> works with the idea of deconstructing imagery similar to a honeybee’s vision breaking down
                        into coloured circles, as participants create their own patterns composed of light created by an
                        LED that is restricted by the hexagonal openings on the cluster.
                        <i>Hive’s</i> clusters imitate individual ommatidia, where each cell in a cluster emits a dot of light.
                        Each cluster of
                        <i>Hive</i> is equipped with a lighting system that illuminates the internal structure of the cluster
                        behind semi-transparent acrylic. Every 360 degrees of rotation results in the illumination cycling
                        between two colours of the colour spectrum.

                    <!-- Swarming -->
                    <p>
                        Numerous species, for reasons of migration, foraging, and communication, have a tendency to gather in great, thick clusters.
                        Known as swarming when referring to honeybee behavior, this phenomena affords the bees an effective
                        means of collective communication and decision making. A percentage (roughly 60% of worker bees)
                        of the colony’s population, including the

                        outgoing Queen, will leave the hive due to overpopulation and produce a ‘swarm,' which attempts to create a new hive elsewhere.
                        The honeybees will bunch up onto a nearby surface, like a fencepost for example, near the parent
                        hive and will remain there temporarily while scouting out a suitable new hive. Honeybees have chosen
                        this method of huddling as a way for using their combined body mass to protect the Queen, whose pheromones
                        keep the swarm aware of her presence. While the majority of the swarm remains at this temporary location,
                        a group of individual scout bees will search for a new suitable location to setup a hive. These scouts
                        seek enclosure spaces that are at an optimal location to food sources, and contain enough space to
                        inhabit. Upon returning, the scouts communicate their findings through a “Waggle dance” which is
                        a series of back and forth motions performed at an angle relative to recently discovered location,
                        acting to inform the rest of swarm as to the quality of the potential hive it has investigated. This
                        process takes between two to three days and essentially acts as a method for honeybees to vote on
                        which scout has found the most suitable new nest. Honeybees in contact with a scout will judge the
                        dance it performs and vote on whether or not it is more appealing than the displays of other scouts.
                        If the observing honeybees are excited by the scouts waggle dance, they may leave to further investigate
                        the potential nesting site and promote it through their own waggle dance upon returning to the swarm.
                        However if a more exciting option arises from a different scouts waggle dance, the observing honeybees
                        will literally headbutt and buzz at the less exciting scout until it stops its dancing, resulting
                        in the elimination of less desirable nesting site from the poll. Once a quorum of 80% of honeybees
                        are in agreeance of the most suitable location, the entire swarm will relocate to the site. This
                        phenomenon honeybees “voting” on their favourite location is known as honeybee democracy, a heuristic
                        process that uses numerous simple actions (waggle dance) by individuals to solve a complex problem
                        (swarm inhabiting the most optimal location).

                        Participants experiencing
                        <i>Hive</i> use basic interaction with clusters to construct a complex and collective soundscape, along
                        with light and touch, designed to mimic the honeybee’s physical means of communication. The shear
                        density of the honeybees' swarm means that their excitement or displeasure with the scouts' performed
                        information is, at least in part, communicated in a haptic manner. In a similar fashion, touch is
                        integral to
                        <i>Hive</i> as the external faces of each cluster are fitted with a conductive circuit that detects
                        when the conductive circuit of another cluster comes into contact with it. The completed circuit
                        then emit sound from a speaker inside the cluster. As participants gradually build their “honeycombs,”
                        a soundscape emerges representing a digital interpretation of a swarm’s dense auditory accumulation.
                        This is in accordance with
                        <i>Hive's</i> purpose to provide participants with a form used to transform space through the application
                        of biomimetic principles.
